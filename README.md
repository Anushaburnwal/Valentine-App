# 💘 Valentine App

Welcome to the **Valentine App** – a fun, flirty, and slightly savage way to pop the big question:  
**"Will you be my Valentine?"** 💌

This playful Android app gives your crush (or your bestie) two options:
- **YES ❤️** — and instantly face a cheeky surprise!
- **NO 💔** — and be taken on a funny journey through light-hearted screens that won’t let them reject you so easily 😉
